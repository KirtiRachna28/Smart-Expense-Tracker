## Smart Expense Tracker

A simple command-line Python based application to record and manage daily expenses. This project helps users record their spending and understand where their money goes.

This project was built to practice Python fundamentals such as file handling, modular programming, and basic data processing.


## About the Project

Managing daily expenses can be difficult without proper tracking. This Smart Expense Tracker allows users to:

- Store data in a CSV file
- View saved expenses
- Understand total spending

It is built using basic Python concepts like:

 - Classes
 - Functions
 - File handling
 - Loops and conditionals

  
  The goal of this project is to build a clean and structured Python application while learning software organization and Git usage.

## Features
- Add a new expense
- View all expenses
- Store data in CSV format
- Simple menu-based CLI interface
- Modular code structure
  
## Tech Stack(Built With)
- Python 3.x
- CSV module
- Dataclasses
- Git & GitHub (for version control)

No external libraries required.
